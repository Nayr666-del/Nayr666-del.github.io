# About me

Hi! I’m **Hongyi Xiong**, a 3rd year undergraduate Physicist studying in the University of Oxford. My research interests are in Accretion Disk astrophysics, focusing on hydrodynamical simulations of disk response to SMBH mergers. I am currently interning at the Institute of Science and Technology, Austria (ISTA). 

I enjoy reading science fiction in my free time. I play ice hockey, tennis, and football. I love listening to music and play the piano.
